### Site
We want to create a replica of the game. Note that
[the mobile Gwent app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cdprojektred.gwent)
is not the original game, and we want to replicate the original game, which has 3 rows in each player side, and you can 
play in Witcher 3.  
If you don't want to install Witcher 3, you can also play another
non-original version of the game [here](https://arunsundaram.com/gwent-classic-app/).
